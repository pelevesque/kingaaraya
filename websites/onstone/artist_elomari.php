The studio is untidy; there are things scattered all over the floor. There is a small desk filled with papers, sketches, drawings, a single bed, bookshelves, and a sculptor's tools such as: hammer, pick, and various chisels and files. There are small Inuit stone sculptures "souvenir-like looking" on the desk and on some boxes on the floor. There are also pieces of marble, alabaster, green and soapstone, as well as other stones from the North. In juxtaposition every now and then there is a sentence that enters the frame and moves on the screen until it exits the screen. SENTENCE ON THE SCREEN …Then she smiles, and her eyes look different... A MAN in his 48 years old with Inuit look, sleeps on the bed, in his white pajamas pants, sometimes he moves his fingers, and does some movements that sleeping person would do every now and then. Beside THE MAN, on the ground, there is an empty vodka bottle, an envelope with a Palestinian stamp and sender address, beside the envelope there is a letter. Suddenly, THE MAN opens his eyes, he wakes up, he looks around, looks at the letter on the floor, picks it up, reads it and lets it fall down. THE MAN gets up, walks towards the stove, fills the coffeepot with water and puts it over the stove, then he lights a cigarette. SENTENCE ON THE SCREEN … He lights a cigarette and asks if I mind … THE MAN looks at the window, it is snowing and it is very peaceful outside. He opens the door of the balcony and goes outside barefooted. THE MAN walks on the snow, towards the end of the balcony. SENTENCE ON THE SCREEN …She enters the room holding a puppet, there is a badge covering her left eye, she smiles and heads toward her mother, my heart is beating, I'm trying to hold my tears I'm happy she is alive… The snow is melting under Nanook's feet; there is circular puddle around his feet. THE MAN returns to his studio; he walks towards the stove; the water in the coffeepot evaporated and its bottom is burned dark red. THE MAN takes the coffeepot and fills it with water then puts it again on the stove. CUT TO: MONTREAL - NANOOK'S BED ROOM - DAY THE MAN sits on the floor, beside him there are: a cup of coffee, cigarette and an ashtray; he is sculpting the stones, he breaks them into small pieces then tries to fit the stones in his hand. THE MAN keeps sculpting until the stone perfectly fills the negative shape of his hand, then he pretends throwing the stones and looks around his studio trying to find a place where he can throw it. The stone slips his hand and hits the small Inuit sculptures and breaks two of them. SENTENCE ON THE SCREEN …How can he be so at ease, how can he be so tolerant with all of us anyway... THE MAN walks towards the broken small Inuit sculptures and looks at them; he returns to his sculpting tools. He continues cutting small stone pieces. THE PHONE RINGS THE MAN looks at the phone tries to ignore it, the phone keeps ringing, THE MAN picks up the phone nervously. THE MAN Yeh?! ... .... THE MAN (in Inuit) Khaled died. ... ... THE MAN hangs up the phone, then he continues sculpting. CUT TO: INT. MONTREAL - POST OFFICE - DAY an opened package full of stones, which THE MAN was sculpting to fit in his hand, a post office employee closes the package and sticks a mailing label with the sender's and recipient's names and addresses on them. We notice that the address of the recipient is in Palestine. FADE OUT TO WHITE.</p><!-- image 1 --><div id="floatleft"><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone1.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone1_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone1"/></a></div></div></div><!-- image 2 --><div id="floatleft"><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone2.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone2_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone2"/></a></div></div></div><!-- image 3 --><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone3.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone3_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone3"/></a></div></div><!-- image 4 --><div id="floatleft"><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone4.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone4_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone4"/></a></div></div></div><!-- image 5 --><div id="floatleft"><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone5.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone5_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone5"/></a></div></div></div><!-- image 6 --><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone6.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone6_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone6"/></a></div></div><!-- image 7 --><div id="floatleft"><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone7.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone7_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone7"/></a></div></div></div><!-- image 8 --><div id="floatleft"><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone8.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone8_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone8"/></a></div></div></div><!-- image 9 --><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone9.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone9_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone9"/></a></div></div><!-- image 10 --><div id="floatleft"><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone10.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone10_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone10"/></a></div></div></div><!-- image 11 --><div id="floatleft"><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone11.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone11_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone11"/></a></div></div></div><!-- image 12 --><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone12.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone12_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone12"/></a></div></div><!-- image 13 --><div id="alpha-shadow"><div><?php echo "<a href=javascript:popup_elomari('images/elomari/stone13.jpg') >"; ?><img src="images/elomari/thumbs/stone13_(thumb).jpg" height="83" width="125" alt="stone13"/></a></div></div><hr/><h4>biography</h4><p class="bio">Majdi El-Omari a Canadian / Palestinian filmmaker, received a BFA from Egypt's Cairo Institute of Cinema and an MFA in Film Production from Concordia University, Montreal/Canada.
