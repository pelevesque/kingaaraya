The ground was covered with white pebbles. Hard, smooth and hot, they pressed into the bottom of my feet that were tired and tight from having walked around the cold concrete streets of Seoul on one rainy Monsoon day. Each pebble, upon contact with my skin, melted through the muscles, into my bones. </p><p>I lied down on the pebbles. </p><p>My naked skin warmed up and started to sweat. Turning my head to the side, the white pebbles stretched ahead like a shore. Reaching out my arm to the side, I grabbed a handful of the pebbles and dropped them one by one onto the ground. The sound rang sonorously in my mind. </p><p>The pebbles immediately transported me to the summer nights in my childhood in Seoul, when it was too hot to sleep and I would play omok with my Dad in our pajamas. The objective of this age-old game was to create a line on the board with 5 pebble pieces, either Black or White. I would sit, thinking, while grinding the polished white pebble pieces in my little hands that were then too small to grab more than a few at once. During these nights the cicadas sang out their souls outside our balcony, and my Mom created unforgettable aromas with her late night cooking.</p><p>Many many years later, I smiled with my eyes closed in the white pebble room in a public bath and sauna in Seoul. Filled with memories of summer nights in my childhood, warmth pulsated throughout my body and soul with the echo of every white pebble that rolled on the ground.</p><hr/><h4>biography</h4><p class="bio">Sunhye Hwang is a South Korea-born artist who is currently pursuing her Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Sculpture at Concordia University in Montreal.
