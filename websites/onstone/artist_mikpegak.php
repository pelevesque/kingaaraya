When the stones are arranged in a human-like form we called them Inukshuk. Literally, Inukshuk means in English “they look like human beings”. Their forms are different, some of them can be tall up to 8 feet, the others are smaller. We put Inukshuks on the hills so when we see them we know where we are and which direction we should be heading. We also used the Inukshuk to hunt caribou. We put Inukshuks in a “V” shape, three on each side towards an open spot. The caribou thinks that the stones are people, where in fact, there are only two or three of us directing the animal to the open spot to kill it with bows and arrows. I remember that as a kid and teenager, I used to throw stones in competitions with my cousins. We wanted to test our strength and see who is the best stone thrower. We also used to throw stones at each other, especially at the Cree people; once my head got hit and it really hurt. </p><hr/><h4>biography</h4><p class="bio">Paulossie Mikpegak was born in the Spring in a camp, up the Kuujuuarapik river (Great Whale River) in Hudson Bay Coast in Northern Quebec. His culture is Inuit, and his first language is Inutitut. He grew up hunting and camping with his family up North. When he was 5, he attended English Federal Day School in Kuujuuarapik. Since there were no high schools in his village, at the age of 17, he went to the Boarding High School in Ottawa. At the age of10 he got his first hunting experience by killing a goose with a shotgun, the next summer he caught the seal. At 19, he got a whale. Paulossie lives between his native Kuujuuarapik and Montreal. He frequently attends pow-wows and other Native ceremonies across Quebec and Ontario during which he engages in his favorite activity, dance.</p><?php include('includes/footer.php'); ?>
