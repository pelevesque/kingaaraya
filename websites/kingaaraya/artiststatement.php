These two forms of narration have been guiding me for the past few years. They relate to the formation of individual and societal &#8220;self&#8221;. My sculptures, videos, drawings and performance artworks problematize the formation of the &#8220;self&#8221; that has been always already inscribed within a context of family, community, and nation. The dichotomy of personal vs. social, individual vs. collective, and aesthetic vs. everyday is important to me. While constantly moving <span class="italic">in</span> and <span class="italic">out</span> of different socio-political, geographical and cultural frames, I examine an itinerant &#8220;self&#8221;, my <span class="italic">becoming identity</span>.I often posit rhetorical questions such as, <span class="italic">who are we?</span>and <span class="italic">why are we where we are?</span></p><p>The phenomenon of <span class="italic">walking</span> and <span class="italic">talking</span>in-between diverse cultures, countries and languages became a condition <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> of my artistic practice. I often question my belonging to one group or another I encounter during my journeys.The driving force behind my artworks lies in an impossible desire to create anempowered and authentic &#8220;self&#8221; that would displace the prosthetic origins or our culturally and politically conditioned &#8220;identities&#8221;.</p><p>My art making process constantly opens up new areas of indeterminacy that speak notonly about aesthetics and beauty, but also about power relations. This <span class="italic">unpresentable</span> longing to exhaust human creativedesire to go beyond a given <span class="italic">status quo</span>, places me in themiddle of a hybrid space and forces me to translate it into visual artworks. My compulsive quest to find beauty in uneasy situations directs me towards the fragility of glass, iron, copper, and wood materials and towards video, sound and performance art forms. The formal and conceptual qualities of my artworks want to challenge a socio-cultural space where the meaning is circular and it seems to collapse.</p></div><?php include('_includes/footer.inc'); ?>
