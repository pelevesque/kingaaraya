Kinga walks in the gallery with three legs (one is real prosthesis) carrying a cup of tea in one hand and pointing with the video camera, attached to her hand, at the people in the gallery. There were two videos projected during the performance: one of them was a prerecorded selection of places lived and/or visited by Kinga (Polish, Canadian and American landscapes),the other video was an instantaneous transmission from the gallery. Both images were juxtaposed on the gallery&#8217;s wall. </p></div></div><?php include('_includes/footer.inc'); ?>
