The women were classified as &#8220;gente scomoda&#8221; (uncomfortable people); their personal documents were taken away and they were not allowed to move freely in the village. During the performance, with the help of the local people (some of them were immigrants), the colored stones were progressively placed up to the point where the women walked during their daily supervised &#8220;Uscita Libera&#8221; (free walk). </p></div></div><?php include('_includes/footer.inc'); ?>
