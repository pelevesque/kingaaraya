My contention is that Wodiczko不 and Piper不 walks in the city can be examined by applying a threefold understanding of exile. First, these important performative artworks made manifest in the form of artistic walks are marginalized within, or exiled from, an institutionalized mainstream art. Second, the artists themselves communicate either personal or metaphorical states of exile. Third, the phenomena of contemporary metropolises, as diverse as the communist Warsaw and the capitalist New York of the 1970&#8217;s are analyzed as alienating and exilic social dwellings par excellence in which most of the inhabitants do not feel &#8220;at home&#8221;.</p></div><?php include('_includes/footer.inc'); ?>
