Kinga was dressed in Canadian garments made out of van Dycke photographic transfers of different personal and official Canadian documents on cotton fabric. Material: two videos: on one tape Kinga reads official Canadian documents, on the other she reads personal rejection letters from possible Canadian employers juxtaposed with slowed down fragments of the walks in Ottawa. Each tape is 30 minutes long. This artwork was exhibited for the BFA graduate exhibition in an installation situation: Kinga wore the clothing (bra, underwear, long dress, jacket, shoes, and a bag) and two videos were screened on sperate monitors.</p></div></div><?php include('_includes/footer.inc'); ?>
