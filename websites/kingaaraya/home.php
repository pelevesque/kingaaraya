Her interdisciplinary artworks (drawing, sculpture, photography, video and performance art) investigate movement (walking) and communication (talking). The formal and conceptual hybridization within Araya&#8217;s studio art practice is a result of intellectual sublimation of her artistic and personal displacements (during the summer of 1988, while on a student trip, she literally walked away from communist Poland, defecting in Florence, Italy). She welcomes interdisciplinary artistic approaches because they help her to unravel the complexity of our world and challenge the socio-cultural space where the meaning is circular and it seems to collapse.</p><p>In the Spring 2004 she completed doctoral studies in the Special Individualized Program at Concordia University in Montr&eacute;al. Her doctoral research was twofold: studio art practice and critical theory. Therefore her doctoral thesis consisted of an art exhibition and an academic paper. The thesis paper, &#8220;Walking in the City: Motif of Exile in Performances by Krzysztof Wodiczko and Adrian Piper,&#8221; investigated two art performances involving walking in the city that are conceptualized as exilic works of art: Krzysztof Wodiczko&#8217;s Vehicle, performed in Warsaw in 1973, and AdrianPiper&#8217;s Catalysis, performed from 1970 to 1971, in New York City. Araya&#8217;s doctoralthesis exhibition,  &#8220;Prosthetic Self,&#8221; visualized some of her concerns regarding a contemporary performing identity. The exhibition consisted of a sculpturalinstallation (105 pairs of used wooden crutches and audio). </p><p>She also holds a Master of Fine Arts (Visual Arts) from York University in Toronto and twoBachelor of Fine Arts in Studio Arts and Art Theory &amp;   History with an ItalianLiterature minor from University of Ottawa in Ottawa, all of which were completedwith High Academic Distinctions. Her experience in art history dates back to 1986when she was a student at the Catholic University of Lublin (KUL), Poland. Duringher two years at KUL, she studied ancient, medieval, and renaissance art history inconjunction with philosophy of art and critical theory.</p></div><?php include('_includes/footer.inc'); ?>
